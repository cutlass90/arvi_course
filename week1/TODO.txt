1. Write image loader with preprocessing.
    1.1 normilize: find mean and std of dataset
    1.2 resize, crop, mirror, rotate
    1.3 write reader, that return image and appropriate class as np.array
    1.4 May be add other augmentation.
    1.5 Create batches with balanced class distribution
2. Write trainer.
    Module that using image loader train network, layer by layer.
3. Write model that using pretrained model perform search top n similar images and
    get image class.
4. Write model that using image embeddings perform dimentionality reducing,
    and visualize dataset on 2D or 3D.
5. Look to dataset. Image shapes, class distribution ...
